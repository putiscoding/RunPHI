### RunPHI

## General info
rumPHI comes with a build script that automates the process. For now, being in the testing phase, the user will have to:
copy to /usr/share/runPHI
the scripts present in tools together with utils. The built-ins folder will also go there. This is because in a future iteration we will expect a build file with kernels and then we will expect one with cross-compiling. In that case the user will have to export the entire /usr/share/runPHI content to the target.
